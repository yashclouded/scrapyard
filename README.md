# Scrapyard

Welcome to [**Scrapyard**](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com), Hack Club's winter 2025 worldwide hackathon!

## Developing

You'll need NodeJS and Git installed to run the website locally and test changes - go to https://nodejs.org/en to download NodeJS and https://git-scm.com/ to download Git.

Once you have NodeJS installed, clone this repository using git (in the terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/hackclub/scrapyard.git`) and install the dependencies using `yarn`. You should then be able to run `yarn dev`, which will start a local development server that you can then use to test your changes.

Ask in the [#scrapyard](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0864GFN63X) channel if you have any questions!
